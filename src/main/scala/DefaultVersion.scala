/**
 * DefaultVersion demonstrates a straightforward, idiomatic Scala program using basic language features.
 * This version serves as the foundation for understanding more advanced Scala concepts demonstrated
 * in other versions (CatsEffectVersion, FutureVersion, DIVersion, etc.).
 *
 * '''Key Scala Features Demonstrated:'''
 *  - '''Singleton Objects''': Using `object` instead of `class` to create a single instance
 *  - '''Immutability''': All values are declared with `val` (immutable references)
 *  - '''Higher-Order Functions''': Using `map` to transform collections
 *  - '''Java Interoperability''': Using Java NIO for file operations with Scala converters
 *
 * '''Program Flow:'''
 *  1. Read CSV file → List of String lines
 *  2. Parse lines → List of Protagonist instances
 *  3. Ask user for age increment
 *  4. Transform protagonists by updating ages
 *  5. Serialize protagonists back to CSV format
 *  6. Write to file
 *
 * '''Note for Students:'''
 * This version executes operations immediately (eager evaluation) and produces side effects
 * (file I/O, console I/O, printing). Later versions will show different approaches to managing
 * these side effects, including referential transparency (CatsEffectVersion), concurrency
 * (FutureVersion), and dependency injection (DIVersion, GivenUsingVersion).
 */
object DefaultVersion {
  /**
   * Entry point that orchestrates the read-update-write workflow.
   *
   * '''Scala Features in This Method:'''
   *  - '''`val` declarations''': Immutable local variables (lines, protagonists, etc.)
   *  - '''Type inference''': Scala infers types; we could write `val lines: List[String] = ...`
   *    but it's redundant
   *  - '''Underscore syntax''': `updateAge(_, n)` is shorthand for `p => updateAge(p, n)`
   *
   * '''Evaluation Model:'''
   * Each line executes immediately and in sequence. This is "eager" evaluation—contrast this
   * with CatsEffectVersion where operations are built into a description (IO monad) and
   * executed later.
   *
   * '''Learning Path:'''
   * After understanding this version, examine:
   *  - '''CatsEffectVersion''': Same logic, but with referential transparency
   *  - '''FutureVersion''': Same logic, but with concurrent execution
   *  - '''DIVersion/GivenUsingVersion''': Same logic, but with testable abstractions

   * '''Scala Features:'''
   *  - '''`private val`''': Immutable constant accessible only within this object
   *  - The type of the field (`Path`) is inferred from the method declaration of `Path.of`
   *  
   * '''Design Note:'''
   * Defining this as a constant makes it easy to change and improves code maintainability.
   * In DIVersion and GivenUsingVersion, you'll see how to inject such configuration values.

   *

   * '''Side Effects:'''
   * This method has two side effects:
   *  1. Prints to console (output side effect)
   *  2. Reads from console (input side effect)
   *
   * In CatsEffectVersion, you'll see how to make this referentially transparent by wrapping

   * for testing (no real console needed in tests).

  /**
   * Creates a new Protagonist with an updated age.
   *
   * '''Scala Features:'''
   *  - '''Case Class `copy` method''': `p.copy(age = newAge)` creates a new instance with
   *    modified fields. This is key to immutability—we never mutate `p`
   *  - '''String Interpolation''': `s"..."` lets us embed variables with `$variable` or
   *    expressions with `${expression}`
   *  - '''Named parameters''': `copy(age = newAge)` uses the field name explicitly
   *
   * '''Immutability:'''
   * The original Protagonist `p` is never modified. We create a new instance instead. This is
   * fundamental to functional programming and makes reasoning about code much easier.
   *
   * '''Side Effect:'''
   * The `println` is a side effect that makes this function not referentially transparent.
   * Compare with CatsEffectVersion where this is wrapped in `IO`.

  /**
   * Writes a list of strings to a file, with each string as a separate line.
   *
   * '''Scala Features:'''
   *  - '''`mkString`''': Joins list elements into a single String with a separator
   *  - '''Java Interoperability''': Uses Java's `Files.writeString()` 
   *
   * '''Why `mkString`?'''
   * `lines.mkString("\n")` converts `List("a", "b", "c")` to `"a\nb\nc"`. This is a common
   * pattern for serializing collections to text.
   *
   * '''Side Effect:'''
   * Writing to a file is a side effect. This method modifies external state (the file system).
